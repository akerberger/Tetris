# Tetris

Object oriented version of the game Tetris. 

I have done this to practice object orientated programming and to learn!


You need to have a text document called "HighScore" in the source code map.

In the game-package are the following classes:

GUI -             the window of the game
GameController -  manages the logic
ProgramStarter -  main method
HighScore -       class for HighScore objects

The listeners-package contains:
 * Listeners for the buttons New Game and Pause
 * Listener for the Timer that excecutes commands during the game
